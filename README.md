# Stock_Price_Predictor
This capstone project was created as part of [Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). The full description of the project can be found in the ![Project Report](Capstone Project.pdf).

This project tests the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithms to predict future prices of stocks. The final tuned model produced more accurate Adjusted Closing Price predictions than the benchmark for a date that was four days into the future from a requested date for the four companies that were analyzed.

## Technologies used:

Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Scikit-Learn, PyQt4, QT Designer
